# UDIO
Udio is a peer to peer platform for helping package delivery. It matches a sender of a package with a person travelling in the same direction in their own cars. Udio calculates the payment for each package delivery and could reduce the cost to great extend since all intermediate procedures are not included. It has been implemented as a web application.
