# UDIO
Udio is a peer to peer platform for helping package delivery. It matches a sender of a package with a person traveling in the same direction in their own cars. Udio calculates the payment for each package delivery and could reduce the cost to a great extent since all intermediate procedures are not included. It has been implemented as a web application.
